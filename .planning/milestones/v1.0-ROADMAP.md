# Milestone v1.0: Transcription MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-26
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 17

## Overview

Add transcription capabilities to the existing audio recorder desktop app using OpenAI Whisper API. Phase 1 delivers the complete v1 transcription feature: secure API integration, user-friendly UI with progress feedback, timestamped transcript display, and sidecar file saving. Future phases (v2) will add enhancements like batch transcription, editing, and export formats.

## Phases

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Transcription MVP
**Goal**: User can transcribe audio recordings using OpenAI Whisper API with clear feedback and saved results
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: TRAN-01, TRAN-02, TRAN-03, TRAN-04, TRAN-05, TRAN-06, TRAN-07, TRAN-08, TRAN-09, TRAN-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can provide OpenAI API key via environment variable and the app uses it for transcription
  2. User can click transcribe button on any recording and see progress indicator during processing
  3. User sees transcript in modal with word-level timestamps after completion
  4. User receives notification toast when transcription finishes
  5. User finds .txt transcript file saved alongside original audio file
  6. User gets clear error messages for missing API key, network issues, or unsupported formats
  7. User can transcribe common audio formats (mp3, m4a, wav)
  8. App automatically detects language of audio for transcription
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:

- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Setup dependencies and types
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Backend transcription command
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Frontend command wrapper and button
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Transcript display and notifications
- [x] 01-05-PLAN.md — Error handling and verification

### Phase 2: Transcript Management & Enhancements
**Goal**: Enhance transcription with batch processing, editing, search, and export capabilities
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: TRAN-11, TRAN-12, TRAN-13, TRAN-14, TRAN-15, TRAN-16 (v2 requirements)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can select multiple recordings and transcribe them in batch
  2. User can edit transcript text directly in the app
  3. User can search within transcript content for keywords
  4. User can export transcript to multiple formats (SRT, VTT, JSON)
  5. App identifies different speakers in transcript (speaker diarization)
**Plans**: 6 plans

Plans:

- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Batch transcription UI and backend
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Transcript editing and saving
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Search across transcripts
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Export to SRT, VTT, JSON formats
- [x] 02-05-PLAN.md — Speaker diarization (identification) (deferred)
- [x] 02-06-PLAN.md — AI summary generation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Scalability
**Goal**: Redesign UI into three-page layout (Library, Editor, Insights) with enhanced transcript viewing and AI insights
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: UI-01, UI-02, UI-03 (see CONTEXT.md for details)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can browse recordings in Library page with table view (waveform, status, metadata)
  2. User can navigate to Editor page for a selected recording
  3. Editor page shows transcript with speaker segmentation, click‑to‑play timestamps, and search
  4. Editor page displays AI insights (summary, recommended actions, key topics)
  5. Navigation between Library, Editor, and Insights (placeholder) works via header
  6. UI matches provided mocks for Library and Editor pages
 **Plans**: 6 plans

Plans:

- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Foundation & Routing (shared layout, pages)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Library Page (table, status badges, filters)
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Editor Layout & Player Sidebar
- [x] 03-04-PLAN.md — Transcript View & Search
- [x] 03-05-PLAN.md — AI Insights Sidebar
- [x] 03-06-PLAN.md — Integration & Polish

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**

- Use OpenAI Whisper API — Faster implementation, no large model download, cost per minute acceptable (Outcome: Pending)
- API key via environment variable — Simpler for initial release, avoids building settings UI (Outcome: Pending)
- Save transcripts as `.txt` files — Easy to locate, no database overhead, portable (Outcome: Pending)
- Button in list + modal display — Consistent with existing UI pattern, clear user flow (Outcome: Pending)
- Transcript editing saves to same sidecar .txt file pattern — Consistency with existing transcription output, no new file format (Outcome: Implemented 02-02)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Fixed Tauri v2 capability schema mismatch for HTTP permissions
- Fixed async-openai feature configuration (added chat-completion feature)
- Fixed import path mismatches for OpenAI types
- Added file size validation (25 MB limit) as critical security/performance requirement
- Added empty transcript validation for AI summarization
- Fixed duplicate mock-recording useEffect in Library page

**Issues Deferred:**

- Speaker diarization (identification) deferred to future phase
- New Recording button placeholder (non-functional)
- Custom scrollbar not applied to all scrollable containers
- Tech debt: missing duration, static waveform, error swallowing (deferred per project direction)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Legacy Dashboard component deprecated but not removed
- UI inconsistencies (scrollbar styling, button placeholder)
- Some workflows still have hardcoded paths (fix in future phase)
