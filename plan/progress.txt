=== Task 1: Setup - Create Next.js App Router + Tauri desktop app baseline ===
Date: 2026-01-23 09:45

What I did:
- Created Next.js 15 app with TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint
- Initialized Tauri v2 with src-tauri/ directory and configuration
- Configured Next.js for static export (output: 'export') required by Tauri
- Set up Tailwind CSS with PostCSS and proper content paths
- Created minimal app structure: app/layout.tsx, app/page.tsx, app/globals.css
- Configured TypeScript with proper paths and Next.js plugin

Commands run:
- npm init -y
- npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest typescript @types/react @types/node @types/react-dom tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer eslint eslint-config-next
- npm install --save-dev @tauri-apps/cli
- npm install @tauri-apps/api
- npx tauri init --ci
- npm run build (Next.js static export)
- npx tsc --noEmit (TypeScript check)

Result:
✅ Next.js builds successfully with no errors
✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
✅ Tailwind CSS is working (classes appear in output HTML)
✅ Tauri structure created (src-tauri/ with Cargo.toml, tauri.conf.json, Rust source)
✅ Static export generates out/ directory correctly
⚠️  Tauri production build requires Rust/Cargo installation (not available in environment)
   However, all configuration is correct and ready for dev/build when Rust is available

The baseline is complete and ready for development.
